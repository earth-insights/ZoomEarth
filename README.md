  <p>A Multimodal Visual Question Answering Dataset for Remote Sensing Imagery</p>
</div>

## 🚀 Overview

**ZoomEarth** is a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate visual reasoning and question answering capabilities on **high-resolution remote sensing imagery**.  
The project integrates **visual understanding, spatial reasoning, and semantic grounding** across multiple scales of Earth observation data.

---

## 🧠 Model

Our model, **ZoomEarth-LLaVA**, is built upon a vision-language architecture that aligns remote sensing imagery with textual queries.  
It supports fine-grained reasoning, spatial context interpretation, and multi-level object understanding.

- Model weights: *coming soon*  
- Training scripts: [./scripts/](./scripts)  
- Inference example: [./inference/](./inference)
